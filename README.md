Smarter scheduling through clinical insight.

ClinSense AI is an intelligent appointment management system that prioritizes patients based on condition severity and doctor availability—making hospital queues faster and fairer.

Patients provide their name, disease type, preferred doctor, and time slot. The system then analyzes severity, assigns the best doctor and time, rearranges queues in real time, and notifies both patient and doctor. This ensures urgent cases get timely care, resources are used efficiently, and patient experience improves.

Our project “Smart Appointment Prioritisation using Agentic AI” is currently in a prototype stage and not fully functional yet. In the future, we aim to integrate real-time notifications and call features between patients and doctors to make communication faster, smoother, and more efficient.
